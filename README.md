# E Ticketing System
 The Bus Ticket Booking System is a console-based application developed in C that streamlines the process of reserving bus seats. Users can log in, check available seats, and book tickets by entering their name and phone number, while the system also allows for easy booking cancellations. With data stored in text files, it ensures persistence and reliability for all booking information. Additionally, the application features an authority access level for administrators to manage and view all bookings efficiently. This project not only showcases essential programming concepts like file handling and user interaction but also provides a practical introduction to system design for those looking to enhance their C programming skills.
